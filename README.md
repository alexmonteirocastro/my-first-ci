# Continuous Integration using CircleCI-2.0

## Description 

This is an experimental project for educational purposes. 
In this project I will learn how to set up a CI usiong CircleCI-2.0

### What I have here

- a Simple flow
    - sequential
    - with an approval step
    - with attaching t=data to a workspace

Also I have a scheduled flow.
  - This flow uses cron and a filter
  - It should run every working day at 8AM

I have also configured my git settings to val;idate the YAML confighuration file before each commit. 

## Future plans

In the future I might try other tools such as:

- Jenkins
- TravisCI
